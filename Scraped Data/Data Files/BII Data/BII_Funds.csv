Due diligence findings indicate that the capacity, visibility, and fundraising traction of Delivery Organisations is durably enhanced by successful participation to impact bonds. The assumption that impact bonds can help reduce drop-off risks within the development sector will be tested through this investment and we note that involvement of local/national governments or stakeholders as Outcome Payers further increases the likelihood of enduring impact.","Efficiency Risk","Pertains to the risk that impact of individual impact bonds could be achieved without the impact bond structure, or inaccurate forecasting of impact and costs at the impact bond level could result in “over-paying” for a given impact. Track record of other impact bonds suggests that these structures can provide a more cost-effective use of public/philanthropic funds, so this risk is deemed low.","Goal 3: Good health and well-being,Goal 4: Quality education,Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth",,7,,"Fully qualified",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catalyst,,01/06/2025,Active
