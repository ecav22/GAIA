An expanding construction sector, boosted by population growth and urbanisation, also puts pressure on resources.   Durabric bricks are produced from a mixture of earth and cement, compressed in a mould, and left naturally to cure without firing. This process saves up to 14 trees per house. By avoiding this firing phase, Durabric reduces greenhouse gas emissions tenfold.  Since 2016, 14Trees has already sold about 1 million Durabric bricks in Malawi, most of which have been used for the construction of schools.  14 Trees is looking to expand its operations in Malawi and other countries, which will contribute to the creation of hundreds of new jobs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catalyst,,01/06/2025,Active

The supply of hydroelectricity to the national grid addresses: SDG 7.2 by increasing the share of renewable energy within the country's energy mix; SDG 8.5 by addressing power constraints, unlocking productivity gains and having an economic enabling impact on firms and job creation; and SDG 13 by displacing the need for as much fossil fuel combustion within the electricity generation system. From an impact perspective, the investment thesis has been achieved; the plants were completed successfully and are now operational, providing critical infrastructure and electricity services in two East African countries. From a commercial perspective, the sale of the assets has been challenging and is still ongoing, symptomatic of broader issues regarding the depth of the secondary market for renewable energy and power sector assets in Africa. However, the loan was fully repaid in 2024 after the refinancing of two of the operating Ugandan assets by other DFIs.",,,,,,,"Fully qualified",,,,,,True,,,,,,Renewable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Growth,,01/06/2025,Exited

This allows suppliers to better manage their cashflows, liquidity and risk while improving opportunities for productive and more frequent economic participation, ultimately leading to increased revenues, business growth and job creation or retention.","Catalysing markets: Supply chain finance is still nascent in Africa and the continent currently accounts for only 1 per cent of global receivables finance turnover.

The company was the largest taxpayer in Bangladesh at that time. The core of BII’s impact thesis was to support Grameenphone’s rollout of its 3G network across Bangladesh, increasing access to and speed of data services to promote digital inclusion and support the delivery of essential services. At the time of our exit, Grameenphone had demonstrated a significant impact on telecommunications in Bangladesh. The establishment of the 3G network significantly expanded access to data services, including in remote parts of the country. This includes the widely celebrated Village Phone initiative that sought to provide easy access to telephone services all over rural Bangladesh, bridging the information gap between rural and urban areas, and providing income-generating technology.

This demonstrates significant growth and impact on the country’s connectivity, in which our loan played a part. Bangladesh’s mobile industry has scaled quickly since 2012. However, the quality and affordability of services are poor compared to its peers. Millions of people have yet to access fast 3G and 4G connectivity, meaning Bangladesh has one of the lowest internet penetration levels in the region.

At the time, Grindrod Limited was a Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)-listed and South Africa focused company made up of three divisions: shipping, freight, and financial services.  Our initial investment thesis was two-fold. First, we intended to generate $50-100 million of co-investment opportunities to provide much-needed improvements to ports, logistics and rail in Africa. In turn we anticipated these projects would directly create about 1,900 jobs in Grindrod's existing business.  However, a weak commodity price environment caused several pipeline co-investment projects to fall away and led to job losses at Grindrod. Second, we intended to support the company to improve its environmental and social systems and practices. Through our participation in the Safety, Health, Environmental and Quality Committee, we supported Grindrod in upgrading its environmental and social policies and some management plans. The progress made was deemed a success by a commissioned third party.",,"Regional trade has an important role to play in long-term growth in Africa, especially since many African economies are not large enough to build strong internal markets. Yet intra-African trade levels are very low, representing only 16 per cent of Africa’s overall trade.

Grow Indigo aims to transform the Indian smallholder agricultural sector with more sustainable, regenerative practices. The company does this by creating sustainable products and solutions that help optimise these smallholders’ yields, enhance their incomes and reduce resource wastage.  Our investment will be used by Grow Indigo to onboard smallholder farmers across 14 states in India. Grow Indigo will work with them to adopt regenerative agricultural practices. These initiatives will help enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prevent soil erosion, preserve biodiversity and improve water efficiency.  The project will have an important demonstration effect on the potential for carbon credits to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traditional agriculture and support increased soil carbon stocks.","The investment is classified as Medium-low E&S risks.

Currently, 19 per cent of enrolled farmers are considered low-income (measured by less than 2 hectares of land), although projections are that 82 per cent of participating farmers will be in this category by 2029. The proportion of women is likely to be high based on the type of farming, although historically Grow Indigo has not tracked gender data (they have recently done so following engagements with BII).",Planet,Planet,N/A,,,,"Approximately 165,000 farmers (with approximately 1 million hectares of land) are currently enrolled in the programme. The facility will enable Grow Indigo to reach 1 million additional farmers over the next two years, covering 2.5 million hectares. By 2030, Grow Indigo aims to enrol 2.5 million farmers, with more than 5 million hectares under the programme. 40,000 tons of carbon avoided or removed have been issued from the first project (pending final verification). Grow Indigo's carbon programmes target an average emission reduction of over 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Through our facility, Grow Indigo estimates it will be able to issue an additional 15 million carbon credits.","- Depth: Modelling done by Grow Indigo shows that rice and wheat farmers can expect to see an increase in incremental earning per hectare of 10-15 per cent, taking into account improved productivity and carbon credit revenue. Non-financial impact includes health benefits (e.g. decreased exposure to water-borne disease and reduced musculo-skeletal disorders). - Duration: Farmers are enrolled in the programme for 20 years, unless they voluntarily unenroll before this period.",,"Financial additionality: Lack of any other potential providers of Kinetic-like capital for Grow Indigo.","Execution Risk","Given the risks of the investment (e.g. unknown commercial viability, carbon market uncertainty, ramp up in scale, adoption of new practices), there will likely be substantial execution challenges. These risks must be tolerated (hence the need for Kinetic capital) but are mitigated by partnering with a strong company with reputable sponsors, and an existing pilot phase that has proven relatively successful so far.","Stakeholder Participation Risk","Participating farmers may not fully understand the mechanics of the programme, and how/when they will receive payments related to carbon credits. If not transparently communicated, this can lead to significant issues around trust (which we have seen in other carbon credit models). This risk is mitigated by the clear communication by Grow Indigo with farmers; the commitment that they will receive a large portion of all carbon revenue; and due diligence showed that Grow Indigo has a robust approach to community engagement and participation.",,,"Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth,Goal 13: Climate action",,,,,,,,"Fully qualified",,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kinetic,01/06/2025,01/06/2025,Active

Only 0.5 per cent are women.  - B2B segment (trucking): Truck delivery partners typically have revenue less than $10,000 per month, owning at least two trucks, responsible for managing daily trucks operations, and hiring truck drivers and assistants on their payroll.

Given the high level of unemployment in Loadshare’s markets and that 25 per cent of delivery staff accessed their first formal employment opportunity through Loadshare’s delivery partners, we still expect the increased earnings to be material. Average annual earnings per delivery executives is $630 vs poverty line of $200 per annum in India’s urban areas and $168 per annum in rural areas. Delivery staff also receive significant training which can help them progress to other jobs, as well as financing support to acquire productive assets. - Duration: Employment growth is expected to be material as soon as financial year 2021 and the impact is expected to be sustained over the life of the company.","3.0  Market context: There is a lack of capital for early stage ventures in India. 2015-2018 CAGR growth for Series B financing was only 3 per cent by value and 2 per cent by volume vs 15 per cent by value and 13 per cent by volume for mega venture capital (over $100 million).","- Value additionality: BII and Loadshare will co-design and execute a technical assistance programme to help improve job quality for delivery partners’ employees and help Loadshare to indirectly attract, enable, and retain talents from across the country, which is core to the company’s business model.

These operators would otherwise not receive affordable and commercially viable financing from financial institutions for buying electric vehicles. Due to the high upfront costs of electric vehicles and familiarity with internal combustion engine vehicles instead of electric vehicles, driver-owned models are not possible with electric vehicles.

In 2020, CDC increased the facility to $200 million to provide additional counter-cyclical support during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the indirect economic impacts of the crisis. The agreement allows SMBC BI to increase its limits to local banks, which has the potential to increase the total volume of short-term trade credit by up to $450 million per annum. This will allow domestic banks in Africa to support trading businesses in importing commodities and equipment and ultimately support economic opportunities and access to goods for employees and consumers.

The company offers loans for predominantly income-generating assets and is active through two main products: MSME loans (87 per cent) and two-wheeler loans (11 per cent). Namdev recently launched a first electric vehicle/solar loan product, financed by the Symbiotics Green Basket Bond (backed by BII) which it plans to scale over the next few years. The company is highly focused on rural lending and scaling up its green financing portfolio. Its data suggests that 66 per cent of its customers have monthly household incomes below INR 28,000 (BII’s low-income proxy for India). Furthermore, because many of Namdev’s customers are new to credit, this supports financial and economic inclusion, as lower-income individuals are less likely to secure finance from traditional lenders.

Our investment aimed to bring quality education to over one million children and create 20,000 meaningful jobs in places where, at the time of our investment, the unemployment rate for the target demographic was very high. At the time of exit (2022), NewGlobe Schools had performed well against our original impact thesis.

Data showed that 89 per cent of NewGlobe employees came from extremely low-income households, and 61 per cent of whom were female. Scale of impact: When we first invested in 2013, NewGlobe Schools had 60,880 students and expected the number of students to increase to more than 890,000 by the end of 2020. NewGlobe schools currently reach millions of students through public-private partnership contracts. In terms of job creation, at the point of exit NewGlobe employed 5,552 individuals, which was in line with its new business model of working with government-employed teachers instead of directly employing teachers, which would have required a higher rate of employment, as envisaged in the impact case.

We invested alongside the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and other investors including the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, Bill Gates, NEA and the Omidyar Network.  We invested to enable NewGlobe Schools (the then parent company of Bridge International Academies) to bring quality primary education to over 1 million children on the poverty line.  We exited this investment in 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goal 4: Quality education","Impact achieved at exit: The original impact thesis centred around supporting NewGlobe Schools' (the then parent company of Bridge International) innovative model, which had proven potential to build a sustainable approach to educating children from extremely low-income households (below the $2 per day poverty line). Our investment aimed to bring quality education to over one million children and create 20,000 meaningful jobs in places where, at the time of our investment, the unemployment rate for the target demographic was very high. At the time of exit (2022), NewGlobe Schools had performed well against our original impact thesis. After changing its business model from owning and running schools itself to supporting government school systems with educational technology, NewGlobe extended the scale of its reach and was on track to outperform our impact expectations of reaching one million students. Stakeholders: In line with our expectations at entry, 100 per cent of NewGlobe students were from low-income households (living below $2 per day). Data showed that 89 per cent of NewGlobe employees came from extremely low-income households, and 61 per cent of whom were female. Scale of impact: When we first invested in 2013, NewGlobe Schools had 60,880 students and expected the number of students to increase to more than 890,000 by the end of 2020. NewGlobe schools currently reach millions of students through public-private partnership contracts. In terms of job creation, at the point of exit NewGlobe employed 5,552 individuals, which was in line with its new business model of working with government-employed teachers instead of directly employing teachers, which would have required a higher rate of employment, as envisaged in the impact case. At the time of exit, NewGlobe was serving 1,003 government schools. Quality of learning outcomes: There was evidence that NewGlobe’s approach to elementary education was effective. An academic study found that primary students (through to Grade 8 in NewGlobe's Kenya programme) gained almost an additional year of learning (0.89) under the NewGlobe integrated methodology; learning in two years what their peers learnt in nearly three. Environmental and social management: We worked alongside other investors – such as IFC and Novastar – to enhance NewGlobe Schools' management of environmental and social issues, including through an initial action plan which focused on life and fire safety; occupational health and safety; labour management; developing an anonymous grievance mechanism; water, sanitation and hygiene standards; the structural integrity of the school estate; and food safety.

Despite initial goals to reach 400,000 smallholder farmers through the PAH model over three years, only approx. 90,000 farmers were reached during a period of two years. Any impact achieved is attributed to the portion of the committed capital that was drawn down (approx. 20% of initial commitment). The PAH was an innovative model aimed to boost agricultural insurance uptake among smallholder farmers, a crucial factor for proving commercial viability of this market segment. The project failed to meet key premium recovery milestones established at the time of the investment. The project’s unfavourable outcome is attributed to uncertainties in market receptiveness, including farmer uptake and participation from supply chain actors and private investors. While smallholder farmers recognized the value of insurance, low uptake and timely repayment rates are due to a still evolving market.

When we ended the risk-sharing facility in 2022, it had cumulatively supported over $38 million in invoices across more than 3,700 transactions of 58 suppliers in Nigeria. While the facility was effective in reaching smaller suppliers, we decided to end the facility as it did not manage to scale to multiple countries as we had originally intended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Growth,,01/06/2025,Exited

Typically, these people are vegetable vendors, maids, porters and construction workers whose annual wage is less than INR 120,000 (c$1,900). In recent years, the MFI has also started to lend to individual micro-entrepreneurs to fund expenditure such as the purchase of equipment or livestock. It also offers family loans to low-income women to cover school expenses of children, medical care, and house repairs.
